All files relating to the my personal webpage located <a href="http://www.hinzdaniel.com">here</a>. I first started this project to provides a place to not only list my experience, but to demonstrate it in greater detail than a resume would allow. Through completion of this project, I was able to learn more about proper HTML structure, responsive web design, and Amazon Web Services. 

### Proper HTML
Before I started this project, I had a very basic understanding of HTML. Through completion of this project, I was able to learn on a lot more about webpage structure, what tags to use for certain tasks, the attributes associated with them.

### Responsive Web Design
Before I started this project, I had never even considered that websites must custom tailor their styles to fit each and every device. This became very apparent to me the first time that I tried opening my webpage on mobile(lol). This resulted in me implementing various responsive features into this webpage such as flexbox, responsive units(such as rem, em, vh, vw), and media queries. 

### Amazon Web Services
In addition to the front-end skills I picked up while completing this project, I was also able to add AWS to my list of resume. I used Amazon S3 and Route 53 to launch and host this site on the web.
